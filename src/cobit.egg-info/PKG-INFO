# COBIT — Cryptocurrency Order Book Ingestion Tool

COBIT is a production-grade, cloud-native ingestion system that retrieves real-time
order book data from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange and stores it in AWS S3 in
a clean, analytics-ready format. It is designed as a standalone utility or as the
data ingestion component of larger ML pipelines (e.g., [ACT-Kraken](https://github.com/dereknugroho/act-kraken)).
